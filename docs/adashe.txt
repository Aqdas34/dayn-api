There'll be one account where by everyone deposits 

This adashe group will be created be one person where by he can also add another person to manage it with him just incase

Then there'll be a need for an adashe group ID that will be generated when a new adashe is created so that people can access that adashe and it is subject to the acceptance by the group creator

The person to collect in that month will be fixed at the top 

And i think people should select there preferred slot just like how it's done

People who have paid and are yet to pay should be indicated as paid or not paid
